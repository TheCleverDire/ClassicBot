# ClassicBot

This is a minecraft classic bot written in C#. Compatible with [Classicube](https://www.classicube.net/).

This project utilizes my socket framework, [ManagedSockets](https://github.com/umby24/ManagedSockets).

I started adding some CPE Support, but havn't really gotten around to it yet.

I did as a fun side project though add support for the import/export format of my old VB Minebot project.

This should utilize how much my coding style has evolved since then.

If you want to fork this and add your own commands, implement CPE, etc, go ahead.

## Classicube Name Verification

I wrote a class to handle authenticating with classicube.net so you can join name verified servers. It's been a while since I tested this, however.
